# AZ-900
Here is the note that I used to prepare for my AZ-900 exam. 
This repository includes both the computer version and the handwritten version. 

For the _**computer version**_, it's suitable for people who want to write their own notes before going to the exam. 
Otherwise, I suggest you choose the **_handwritten version_**. 

Good luck with your exam. :)Â
